        <h1>The Perfect Trip</h1>

        <p>In my "perfect trip" I would not only be able to sleep in every day on a super comfy bed within a beautiful space that I found on airbnb.com for an excellent price/night, but it would also have a full kitchen and a library, and there would be a really awesome marketplace nearby that would give me access to all kinds of fresh, local products so I could make myself breakfast, and other meals if need be. There would an ocean nearby, maybe where I am envisioning being in a cottage somewhere in a small town in Europe that is close to the Mediterranean.<br>  </p>

        <p>I don't really care much about animals, as far as exotic ones go and having access to them. In my ideal vacation it'd be awesome if there were some kittens around, full-grown cats would be ok too. </p>

        <p>Food, yum, I am a total foodie, food nerd, farming method nerd, farmer's market enthusiast. In my ideal vacation, I would be in a town or city with a lot of ethnic markets full of locally grown and harvested produce. There would honey accessible from bees that were pollinating specific kinds of plants that would fortify my immune system. There would be pickled quail eggs and I would have a small bottle of sriracha in my bag, or maybe some other local, badass hot sauce. There would also be some Pho, or soups in general, made from scratch. I am a fan of good food made with good ingredients. In this scenario I don't know what my income would be like, I've never had a huge budget when I travel so I clearly prefer having access to a kitchen and providing for myself, but if I had a really crazy budget, then fois gras and fine fillets and other gourmet meats, poultry, fish all day! Oh yeah, and let me not forget to mention that no awesome time scenario in my life would be complete without access to some really excellent, preferably local, medium roast, coffee.</p>
